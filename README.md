#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
It is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including commerce, communication, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages like Fortran (1957) and C (1972) allowed programmers to write clearer and more efficient code.

The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s, which introduced a more flexible way of developing software.

The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. The NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968) officially recognized software engineering as a structured field.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

Design - creating high-level and detailed software architecture and user interface designs.

Implementation - writing code and building software according to design specifications.

Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

Deployment - releasing the software to users or customers.

Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall - is a sequential approach with distinct phases where each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Waterfall would be appropriate for use in the building of banking systems.

Agile - is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change, where development happens in cycles with continuous testing and user feedback. 
Agile is ideal for the development of mobile applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - writes code and implements software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
Examples include: Visual Studio and Eclipse.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
Examples: Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges:
Changing Requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
Team conflict

Strategies to overcome challenges:
Effective communication
Agile methodologies
Prioritizing tasks
Reassessment of project goals and timelines regularly

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
Ensures components or modules work correctly, and helps catch bugs in the early stages of development.

Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Helps prevent issues when combining components.

System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
It ensures the software system meets requirements and functions correctly.

Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements.
It ensures it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or commands to get the best possible responses from Artificial Intelligence models. It helps avoid confusion by ensuring the AI understands and provides relevant, accurate and useful responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt:
"Tell me about inflation"

Improved prompt:
"Explain inflation and how central banks use monetary policy to control it, with examples from Kenya and the U.S"

The improved prompt provides specific and concise context and requests real-world examples leading to a more accurate and insightful response.
